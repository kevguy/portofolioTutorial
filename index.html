        <h2>Hi !</h2>
        <p>I'm <span>Kev Lai</span>.. I am a <span>web developer</span> which means I play with spider webs as my occupation. I like spider webs, but I'm scared of spiders. I'm still waiting for the day I win a lottery. No luck so far, so I'm still trying to live with <span>spiders</span>. Shit, SPIDERS!</p>
